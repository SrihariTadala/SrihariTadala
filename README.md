## About Me

Aloha! I’m Srihari, a software engineer and problem solver who enjoys building scalable systems and working with generative AI. I earned my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Portland State University, where my focus was software engineering and large language models.
During my time at PSU, I built a  survey platform with multilingual support, and automated tests that achieved 95% code coverage, cutting post-release bugs by nearly 50%. I also modernized HP’s ACE Analytics platform, migrating it from a monolithic architecture to microservices and designing.
I led the development of a student portal for IEEE serving over 2,000 users, and across projects I’ve built secure, reusable backend services in Python and Java, along with modular React components.
I enjoy tackling complex problems with curiosity and persistence, and I’m excited to bring that mindset to full-time software engineering roles.
